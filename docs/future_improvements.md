# Future Improvements for Server Management System

This document outlines potential improvements and next steps for our server management system. These tasks are designed to enhance functionality, reliability, and user experience.

## 1. Testing
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests for `manage_server.py`
- [ ] Create integration tests for the entire server management lifecycle
- [ ] Set up automated testing in CI pipeline

## 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Enhance error messages in `manage_server.py` for clearer debugging
- [ ] Implement try-except blocks for all critical operations
- [ ] Create a custom exception hierarchy for specific error types

## 3. Configuration Management
- [ ] Create a `config.py` file for centralized configuration
- [ ] Implement environment variable support for key settings
- [ ] Add command-line arguments for overriding default configurations

## 4. Logging Improvements
- [ ] Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes
- [ ] Add structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
- [ ] Create different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) for various operations

## 5. API Development
- [ ] Expand API endpoints in `api/src/main.py`
- [ ] Implement input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization mechanisms

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or ReDoc

- [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors or performance issues

## 9. Security
- [ ] Conduct a security audit of the API
- [ ] Implement HTTPS support
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 10. Performance Testing
- [ ] Set up performance testing scripts
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarks
- [ ] Implement load testing scenarios
